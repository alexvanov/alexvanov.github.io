My field of research lies at the interface between numerical and mathematical relativity. Related to the hyperboloidal problem, which I approach with conformal compactification methods, I am interested in hyperbolic gauge conditions for 3+1 formulations of General Relativity and the description of black hole geometries using trumpet slices.
